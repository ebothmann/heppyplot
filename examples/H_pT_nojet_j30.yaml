### Figure settings ###
# The plot title (optional)
title:              'H @ LHC 13 TeV'
# The x axis label (required)
x_title:            '$H$ $p_T$ [GeV]'
# How to draw bins, possible values are 'center' and 'step' (default)
bin_style:          center

### Main plot settings ###
# Where to put the legend, defaults to 'best'
legend_loc:         lower left
# An optional annotation
annotation:         "H + soft jets @ Sherpa LO multi-jet merged\njet $p_T \\leq 30$ GeV, PDF: CT10"
# Where to put the annotation, defaults to 'upper right' ('best' is not supported here)
annotation_loc:     upper right
# Prune the lowest tick, useful when labels from the main and the diff plot overlap
# The default is no
y_tick_prune_lower: yes

# Other optional main plot settings include:
# property              default       overwritable for diff subplot
# band_style            ('ci_band')
# legend_hidden         None
# legend_title          None
# legend_borderpad      1.2
# annotation_borderpad  1.2
# x_lim                 None
# x_lim_trim            no
# y_lim                 None          ✔︎
# horizontal_lines      None          ✔︎
# x_log                 no

# y_max_ticks           None          ✔︎

### Overwritable plot settings ###
# The y axis label (required)
y_title:            '$\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}p_T$ [pb/GeV]'

### Settings and overwrites for diff subplot ###
# These settings will default to the overwritable plot settings above
diff: {
  y_title:     Ratio to CV,
  y_lim:       [0.75, 1.25],

  # Other diff subplot settings:
  # property            default
  # y_tick_prune_upper  no
}

distributions:

  # For each distribution, give at least the path.
  # The path can be either point to single file or to a directory.
  # When path is a directory, all files therein will
  # be used to generate an error band.
  - path:             reweighting-CT10run-CT10
    # The label for the plot legend
    label:            Sherpa internal reweighting
    # For YODA files, the histogram name must be specified:
    histogram_name:   /MC_HJETS_STABLE_CUTS/H_pT_nojet_j30
    # Set hidden to yes to omit this distribution from the main plot
    # (defaults to no)
    hidden:           no
    # If normalized is set to yes, all other distributions
    # in the main plot will be normalized against this one
    # (defaults to no)
    normalized:       no
    # For the diff subplot, hidden defaults to yes (!), normalized to no
    # If no distribution sets hidden to no here, the subplot will be omitted
    diff:             {hidden: no, normalized: yes}
    # specify how the error band ist calculated from the distribution subsets
    # the default is standard_error (which you'd use e.g. for an NNPDF band)
    err_estimator:    asymmetric_hessian_error

  - path:             dedicated-CT10
    label:            Dedicated runs
    histogram_name:   /MC_HJETS_STABLE_CUTS/H_pT_nojet_j30
    diff:             {hidden: no}
